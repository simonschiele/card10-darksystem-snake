# Darksystem Snake
> for card10

Small snake game for card10. Written by simon (simon.codingmonkey@gmail.com)
from Darksystem Village at Chaos Communication Camp 2019. Come visit us! :-)

## Gameplay

Use left + right button to control the snake. A level takes 5 apples. Every
level will be faster than the one before. Also, the snake grows one piece per
apple that it eats. Good luck! :-)
